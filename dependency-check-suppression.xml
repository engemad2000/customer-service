    "Unfortunately, the entry in the OSS index is inaccurate and we believe this to be a false positive.
    Red Hat announced the fixes for this vulnerability in May 2020. 6.2.0.Final was released seven months
    after this in December 2020. https://github.com/OSSIndex/vulns/issues/164 and
    https://github.com/OSSIndex/vulns/issues/185 are tracking the work to correct the index." -->
